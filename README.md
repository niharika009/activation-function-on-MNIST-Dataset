# activation-function-on-MNIST-Dataset
using different activation functions on Keras MNIST dataset of 0-9 handwritten numbers as well as on MNIST fashion dataset. you can download the dataset from kaggle 

Aim:
Use MNIST dataset to train neural networks using gradient descent learning algorithm.Experiments with various Architectures of neural networks, and with different activation functions for hidden and output layers.
